# Astronomy

This repository contains Rodrigo's Astronomy-related projects.
I graduated from Claremont McKenna College in May of 2018 with a dual major in Physics and Economics. My senior thesis project, which I chose to complete as a data analysis project in Astrophysics, really captured my interest in programming, particularly in data analytics.

Since then, I've been expanding my portfolio of programming languages and projects. I hope to continue my career as an amatuer astronomer by contributing to open source astronomical projects. I almost exclusively use Python as the core programming language for these projects - Almost all data archives (especially NASA's) use archaic forms of storing data. Python allows me to construct scripts that automate as much of the data collection as possible and easily transition into insightful data visualizations. Querying the GACS archive was also my first introduction into SQL, although they use ADQL - an astrophysics variation of SQL that offers very useful functions that can construct queries using coordinates and a specified radius around the centerpoint. 

My Projects:

[Accessing the GACS Archive:](https://github.com/RodrigoMejias/Astronomy/blob/master/Gaia%20Satellite%20Project.ipynb)
 
 I followed along examples of the 2016 Gaia DR1 Workshop. Here, I constructed Hertzsprung Russell (relating brightness and temperature) diagrams for all well-behaved stars in the Gaia and Hipparcos satellites. I also constructed proper motion diagrams around the LMC, Pleiades, and Barnard's star.
 
[Thesis - NGC 1817:](https://github.com/RodrigoMejias/Astronomy/blob/master/Astrophysics%20Thesis%20Project.ipynb)

  This is the data analysis for my Thesis project in 2018 for Claremont McKenna College. 
  
  I completed a stellar variability analysis using [Kim and Bailer-Jones machine learning package for classifying variable stars: UPSILoN](https://github.com/dwkim78/upsilon)
  Using data pulled from NASA's K2 Data Archive, I identified stars pertaining to NGC 1817, extracted the associated light curves and used UPSILoN to classify the stars into classes of variable stars.
