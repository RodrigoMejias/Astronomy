Thesis - NGC 1817:
  This is the data analysis for my Thesis project in 2018 for Claremont McKenna College. 
  I completed a stellar variability analysis using Kim and Bailer-Jones machine learning package for classifying variable stars: UPSILoN
  Using data pulled from NASA's Kepler Data Archive, I identified 924 stars pertaining to NGC 1817, extracted the associated light curves and used UPSILoN to classify the stars.
  Using Pandas and Matplotlib, I constructed several data visualizations used for my thesis presentation.
